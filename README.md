# EncryptTool
Encryptor/Decryptor tool

This tool encrypts or decrypts a given file, when dropped into its window. If the file extension ends with ".enc", then it decrypts it and deletes the ".enc" extension from its name, otherwise it encrypts it and appends a ".enc" extension to its name.

It is activated by typing CTRL+ALT+(1 2 3) from any window.
